                    Chance the Rapper’s Coloring Book track “Same Drugs” has a new music video.
                    It begins with Chance sitting at a grand piano, and features the puppets that joined the rapper on
                    the road for the Magnificent Coloring World Tour. Chance debuted it on his Facebook page earlier
                    today via a Facebook Live broadcast. Watch it below via YouTube. It features an alternate version of
                    “Same Drugs” that features vocal contributions from Eryn Allen Kane, Yebba, John Legend, Francis
                    Starlite and Macie Stewart.
                    The Jake Schreier-directed clip follows Chance’s videos for “No Problem” (which featured 2 Chainz,
                    Lil Wayne, Young Thug, and DJ Khaled), “Angels,” and “How Great.” He’s slated to perform at the 59th
                    Grammy Awards next week, where he is up for seven Grammys in total.
                    In a video posted to Twitter just before the video’s premiere, Chance explained how he asked
                    various tech companies if he could premiere the new video on their live streaming services.

At a time when trap en español is reaching more ears worldwide than ever, the artist born Antón Álvarez Alfaro has risen to become one of Spain’s biggest artists in the genre.  So, he has reason to celebrate. In a new video for the self-assured “No Te Pegas” — a lurking, minimal song from his 2017 album Ídolo — C. Tangana flexes in front of a motel sign showing his own name in lights, parties with beautiful women in a high-rise hotel, and recruits Peruvian R\u0026B artist A.CHAL to add a narced out new guest verse. Over email, C. Tangana said, \"We all know Spanish [music] is bigger than ever, god bless Daddy and José. What comes next is the Latin New Wave. A.CHAL's un duro, it became clear to me since he put out his last mixtape. About the video shoot...Las Vegas is a crazy place, I don't remember half of it.\" A.CHAL added: “I met C. Tangana in Brooklyn at a showcase and I fucked with the wave he was creating in Spain. The collab came about organically.
